# Quotes API

Simple Node.js application that exposes an API to get popular quotes.

This sample app was built to showcase the MongoDB for VS Code extension.

## How to start the API server

The API server can be started with:

```
$ node app.js
```
The server will listen for requests on port `3000`. Gitpod will make port `3000` automatically available in the browser and will expose the controls to make the URL public.
